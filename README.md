# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection-Project
Built a machine learning model to detect Parkinsonâ€™s disease using patient voice data.  Preprocessed and analyzed medical datasets with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.  Implemented classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest for diagnosis.
